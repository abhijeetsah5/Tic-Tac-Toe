# Tic-Tac-Toe

Created a browser-based Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring interactive gameplay, real-time win/draw detection, and a clean user interface. Applied core programming concepts such as conditionals, arrays, and event handling while enhancing skills in DOM manipulation and responsive layout design.
